# Workflow & Timeline

## Workflow
1. Store unmodified source files in `data/raw/` (not committed).
2. Clean and save analysis-ready datasets to `data/processed/`.
3. Use `notebooks/` for EDA and experiments (numbered notebooks).
4. Move reusable logic into `scripts/` (data prep, features, training, evaluation).
5. Save plots to `figures/` and report artifacts to `reports/`.
6. Keep proposal + weekly updates in `docs/`.

## Timeline
- Weeks 1–2: data understanding + cleaning pipeline
- Weeks 3–5: feature engineering + baseline models
- Weeks 6–8: survival/longitudinal modeling + validation
- Weeks 9–10: final analysis + report/presentation
